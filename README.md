# simple-graph-rb

This a ruby wrapper for simple-graph .. basically a way to manage graph structures using sqlite3.
The sql for it comes directly from the upstream repository 
https://github.com/dpapathanasiou/simple-graph/ 

the code is a mix of the existing code in python and in go..
take a look at the graphstore_test.rb for usage.

almost finished but not quite..
things remaining to be done is the traversal code (some bugs to be fixed)

But I wanted to put it in github before I went further..
